        "The city became prominent in 1236, when Hasan Beg Saifadin[who?] joined the Bahdinan Principality. In 1842, the principality was dissolved by the Ottomans and the region was administered from Mosul.[9] In 1820, Claudius Rich described Dohuk as a small town of 300 houses and the principal settlement of the Kurdish Doski tribe, who also lived in eighty villages. In 1851, Henry Aaron Stern pointed at the heterogenous composition in the city and mentioned a Jewish presence. He also mentioned that the mayor was a Chaldean Catholic. In 1859, the city had two minyans according to Rabbi Yechiel.[8]"
